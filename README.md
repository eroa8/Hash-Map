# Hash-Map
Hash Map UIC College of Engineering<br />
Designed and implemented a generic hash table in C++ using separate chaining to handle hash collisions, supporting customizable key and value types via templates.
Implemented core map operations (insert, erase, at, contains, clear) with dynamic resizing based on load factor thresholds to maintain performance efficiency.
Developed internal iteration functionality (begin, next) to traverse key-value pairs without exposing the underlying structure.
Added deep copy support through custom copy constructor and assignment operator for safe and predictable memory handling.
Built comprehensive test cases to validate correct behavior, including edge cases like duplicate inserts, rehashing integrity, memory cleanup, and iterator traversal.
Employed clean memory management using manual allocation and deallocation, avoiding memory leaks through proper destructors and helper methods.
